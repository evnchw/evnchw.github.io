This is a whirlwind survey of the top 100 recent papers in decentralized finance, based on Google Scholar citation data.

In this post I attempt to get up to speed quickly on DeFi. Why academic papers and not blog posts, tutorials, etc. which are also useful?

1. These papers do often include introductory & motivating content, while showcasing what is new in the field.
2. We have some idea of their influence via citations and other publication metrics.
3. We can ensure that we are sampling a good chunk of topics in DeFi.

To obtain this list, I used the tool [Publish or Perish](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish) to search for the most cited papers in DeFi.

- First, I obtain the first 1,000 papers for DeFi that show up on Google Scholar.
  - **This is roughly Google's "top 1k papers," which we will filter down further.
  - Search query: "defi AND decentralized finance", and only 2013 onward (when Ethereum was released). Omits citation records and patents.
  - 1,000 is the max request limit. We could probably find more, but Google Scholar already returns more influential papers first, and we don't need a perfect list.
  - This list was fetched on July 30, 2024.
- Then I simply sort by decreasing citation count, since my goal is simply to read the most cited papers in the field, from most influential to least influential.
  - [Yes, pure citation count is not perfect by any means](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/37021/why-is-it-bad-to-judge-a-paper-by-citation-count)
- I give some summary statistics on this universe of 1k papers.
- Out of those, I pick **top 100** to read and summarize for this blog post.

Let's go!

## What is decentralized finance?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance):

>  Decentralized finance (often stylized as DeFi) offers financial instruments without relying on intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks by using smart contracts on a blockchain, mainly Ethereum. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on price movements on assets using derivatives, trade cryptocurrencies, insure against risks, and earn interest in savings-like accounts. DeFi uses a layered architecture and highly composable building blocks. Some applications promote high-interest rates but are subject to high risk. Coding errors and hacks have been common in DeFi.

## Summary of Google's top 1,000 papers on DeFi

However, note this includes some noise: papers that were returned by the search query but not related to DeFi.

## The top 100 papers

For each paper, we present three bullet points.

1. Research objective - this covers the main research question(s), the goal of the work, etc.
2. Key findings - this covers important findings and how they were achieved (methodology, etc.).
3. Implications & evaluation - this covers the implications of the research and our opinion on the research overall.
