These are my quick refresher notes on the Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of a probability density over time. Like my notes on [Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman](https://evnchw.github.io/quant/20240623_refresher_hjb), I focus on the main analytical aspects and intuitive understanding rather than the detailed proofs.
