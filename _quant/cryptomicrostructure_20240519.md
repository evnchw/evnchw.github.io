# Crypto microstructure roundup [5/19/24]

Welcome!

In this recurring post series, we'll do a weekly survey of advancements, happenings and movements in the crypto markets, through the lens of [market microstructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_microstructure).

> Market microstructure is a branch of finance concerned with the details of how exchange occurs in markets [ ...] The major thrust of market microstructure research examines the ways in which the working processes of a market affect determinants of transaction costs, prices, quotes, volume, and trading behavior.

Each Sunday post will have two sections, covering happenings during the previous calendar week. (For instance, today we will cover events during 5/12-5/18.)

1. **Market movements**
    - summary of microstructure over the week: trading activity, liquidity, toxicity, etc.
    - deep dives on any major events (macro, regulation, etc.) that moved the market
2. **Hot off the press**
    - any new crypto microstructure papers (academic, whitepapers etc.)

Disclaimers: this will stay fairly high-level and is non-exhaustive. To keep things simple for now, I focus on **BTC/USD trading on Coinbase**. That said, I plan to add other pairs and exchanges in the near future.

Many thanks for swinging by and I hope you will enjoy this series! All feedback welcome.
