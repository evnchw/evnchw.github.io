**Abstract**

```
Blockchain technology can reduce transaction costs, generate distributed trust, and empower
decentralized platforms, potentially becoming a new foundation for decentralized business
models. In the financial industry, blockchain technology allows for the rise of decentralized
financial services, which tend to be more decentralized, innovative, interoperable, borderless,
and transparent. Empowered by blockchain technology, decentralized financial services have the
potential to broaden financial inclusion, facilitate open access, encourage permissionless
innovation, and create new opportunities for entrepreneurs and innovators. In this article, we
assess the benefits of decentralized finance, identify existing business models, and evaluate
potential challenges and limits. As a new area of financial technology, decentralized finance may
reshape the structure of modern finance and create a new landscape for entrepreneurship and
innovation, showcasing the promises and challenges of decentralized business models.

  - **Citations**: 711
  - **Research objective**: Survey the benefits, challenges, and limits of blockchain-based decentralized finance.
  - **Key notes**:
    - This is a business school study.
    - decentralized finance (as of 2020) is not fully interoperable, i.e. integration across protocols (blockchains): 87% of publicly funded DeFi projects were on Ethereum
    - what are the major business models in DeFi?
      - decentralized currencies (Bitcoin, etc.)
      - decentralized payment networks (Libra, Bitcoin, Ripple, etc.)
      - decentralized fundraising
        - initial coin offering: project offers investors stake in token
        - initial exchange offering: project lists on an existing crypto exchange
      - decentralized contracting
        - smart contracts: auto-execute contract when conditions reached
    - risks
      - susceptible to fraud / bugs / risk
      - underlying often has volatility
      - technology push > pull: trap of building tech first, then hoping people will join
    - what are the fundamental limits of defi?
      - cost of distributed trust: inherently costly by distributing info to everyone?
      - user privacy: some protocols (Monero, Zcash) do this but not sure
      - decentralized consensus: may slow major upgrades and innovations
      - accountability: who should be accountable for major issues that come up?
      - not holistic: financial aspects that cannot be recorded objective transactions on the ledger (my thought: credit ratings may be tough)
      - lack of human judgment: may inhibit progress broadly
  - **Overall impression**:
    - Just a quick, readable survey paper of decentralized finance, its business use cases, risks, and limits. Breadth over depth for this one. (Probably things have changed a lot since 2020.)
