# Running list of research ideas - DeFi

- stochastic control approach to incentive programs
- study microstructure of flash loans and how they impact market metrics
- study toxicity in the order flow of decentralized exchanges (Uniswap)
  - trader side: imbalance between "buy/sell" trades against the numeraire
    - toxic because this suggests one side has advantangeous information
    - arbitrage mechanisms not working properly: do we see some kind of mean reverting process (arbitrage working) in the prices or do we see non-reverting trends
  - trader-LPs: imbalance between liquidity taking and making
    - bad because if too much liquidity given vs. taken, can indicate decreasing returns to LP on that side (congestion and crowdedness)
    - conversely, if not enough liquidity given vs. taken, adverse selection of opportunistic arbitrageurs which will manifest in high volatility (and extreme movements along the AMM reserves conservation curve), and eventually push out 
    - in this sense this is a "nested double-sided market":
      - market for liquidity (traders vs. liquidity providers)
      - market on either side of the trade
  - other microstructural measures
    - can we construct some idea of non-executed demand and supply? toward the idea of limit-order books for these protocols
      - could be proxied by traders testing via very small orders etc
      - or can proxy with centralized crypto exchange (CEXs) order book data (say Coinbase for ETH), assuming there is sufficient arbitrage between those CEXs and DEXs (such as Uniswap)
      - important because can predict the market movements of prices and also detect toxicity (say massive sell-off pressure)
        - I presume toxic order flow in the CEXs would manifest at a later time in the protocols, similar to Karim (2022), so this could be a leading indicator
      - estimating the implied supply and demand:
        - "price elasticity of order flow" (Kyle's lambda) --> we know this perfectly in the constant-product AMM because you know exactly how the price will change if you trade an amount X for Y.
    - can go the reduced-form route: examine shocks, say occurrences of FED raising interest rates (causing demand for crypto to slow) and observe the impulse-response before/after of supply and demand and try to estimate the curve.
      - if we build an agent model, say a stochastic control style model, we can do this via simulations
