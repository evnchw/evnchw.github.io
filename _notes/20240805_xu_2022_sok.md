**Abstract**

```
Abstract—As an integral part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, DEX with AMM protocols have gained massive traction with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, AMMs employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based DEX, we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEX’s inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.

  - **Research objective**: Propose a general framework for thinking about decentralized automated market makers (incl. their mechanics, conservation functions, slippage, and divergence), and considering their security/privacy concerns.
  - **Key notes**:
    - Idea: provide a statement of knowledge on AMMs (-DEXs) more formally
    - protocol funded through accrued earnings
    - Preliminaries
      - actors: (1) liquidity providers (2) exchange users (traders) (3) protocol foundation
      - assets:
        - risk assets: e.g. token of interest on the exchange (such as DAI)
        - base assets: e.g. "stable" token on the exchange, say ETH
        - pool shares: you lock up X in the pool, get pool shares which increase proportionally to trading fees
        - protocol "governance" tokens
      - economics, rewards
        - liquidity rewards
        - staking rewards
        - governance rewards
        - security rewards
      - economics, explicit costs
        - liquidity withdrawal fee
        - swap fee
        - gas fee
      - economics, implicit costs
        - slippage: you always take liquidity in doing a trade, so instantaneous slippage. this is like a LOB except that you always move on the curve, whereas in traditional LOB, existing quantities of bid-ask may absorb your appetite to some degree.
        - divergence (impermanent) loss: value of assets in the pool fluctuates over time, so you may contribute X to the pool and yet when you want to withdraw, you only get 0.7X (in real terms of a currency pair, say against USDT or BTC.)
      - the general model of an AMM
        - comment on invalidity of only adding one asset to the pool: for liquidity provision/withdrawal, you cannot only add 1 asset because (by construction) it will throw off the relative proportions of the reserves, and there is no freedom to compute prices. In that sense, adding 1 asset would have to be recomputed across all assets to maintain the relative proportions. For trades, the free parameter is the price, so if you submit X of a reserve, the price and corresponding output gets computed so that the reserves are maintained.
  - **Overall impression**: ...
    - extremely useful mathematical framework for formalizing a decentralized exchange with an AMM mechanism.
