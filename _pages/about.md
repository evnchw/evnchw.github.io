I'm Evan, a quantitative researcher and developer at the [Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA)](https://www.adia.ae/) here in sunny Abu Dhabi.

## My current work

[Risk.net - our scientific investing team](https://www.risk.net/investing/quant-investing/7929061/adia-wealth-fund-is-building-supergroup-of-quant-investing)

My primary work at ADIA focuses on mobilizing alternative data for systematic strategies & quantamental investments, both for research prototypes and production pipelines for systematic strategies.

This is a full-stack quant research & development role:

- sourcing and evaluating datasets
- understanding their informational and statistical content
- preparing features and signals for trading and portfolio optimization
- building and running the production pipelines

I work on complex networks, industrial economics and transportation, and also contributed systematic work involving corporate filings, fundamentals, job postings data, news, and other alternative data.

Since my role is within a scientific investing team, I have also run a number of industry-academic projects via [ADIA Lab](https://www.adialab.ae/), the scientific institution of ADIA. These have primarily been in the form of MSc-level capstone projects:

- UCL/Oxford (MSc MCF): Nowcasting global trade with time series signatures & shipping data (2024)
- University of Toronto (MFRM): Nowcasting inflation with the Baltic indices (2023)
- Khalifa University (MSc Data Science): Studies in supply chains, institutional ownership and geographic revenue (2022)

## Before quantitative finance

Previously in the technology sector, I worked as a data scientist and research scientist at Snap Inc. (2017-2020), primarily on causal inference and econometric analysis to drive product and engineering strategy. Before that I worked briefly at Uber (2016-2017) on optimal driver-rider matching algorithms and engineering.

I studied the [MSc EME](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) program at the London School of Economics, and before that an undergrad in economics, statistics & machine learning at Princeton.

## Other

I am a lifelong classically trained musician (classical and jazz pianist) and so you may also find some quant-music explorations here.
