## My current position

[Risk.net - Adia wealth fund is building supergroup of quant investing](https://www.risk.net/investing/quant-investing/7929061/adia-wealth-fund-is-building-supergroup-of-quant-investing)

I work as a quantitative researcher at ADIA: this spans the full range from research prototypes to final production pipelines for quantitative investments.

- **Data science**: sourcing datasets (financial and alternative), evaluating potential investment alpha
- **Signal development**: statistical analyses on data, developing useful features and signals
- **Portfolio optimization**: constructing and optimizing investment portfolios
- **Seminars**: developing, analyzing and presenting strategies to the wider group for feedback
- **Production**: building and monitoring production data pipelines, monitoring anomalies and investigating outages

**Domain.** I focus on industrial economics, transportation, and complex networks. I have also contributed to other systematic/semi-systematic work involving a variety of useful alternative data.

**Teaching.** Since my role is within a scientific investing team, I have also run a number of industry-academic projects via [ADIA Lab](https://www.adialab.ae/), the scientific institution of ADIA. These have primarily been in the form of MSc-level capstone projects, and some examples include:

- UCL/Oxford (MSc MCF): Nowcasting global trade with time series signatures & shipping data (2024)
- University of Toronto (MFRM): Nowcasting inflation with the Baltic indices (2023)
- Khalifa University (MSc Data Science): Studies in supply chains, institutional ownership and geographic revenue (2022)

## Before quantitative finance

Previously in the technology sector, I worked as a data scientist and research scientist at Snap Inc. (2017-2020), primarily on causal inference and econometric analysis to drive product and engineering strategy. Before that I worked briefly at Uber (2016-2017) on optimal driver-rider matching algorithms and engineering.

I studied the [MSc EME](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) program at the London School of Economics, and before that an undergrad in economics, statistics & machine learning at Princeton.

## Other

I am a lifelong classically trained musician (classical and jazz pianist) and so you may also find quant-music explorations here.
