It's great to meet you, and thanks for swinging by. I'm Evan.

- quantitative researcher & data scientist at the [Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA)](https://www.adia.ae/), previously in tech
- lifelong classical & jazz pianist, and amateur producer: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5DJAcFDVsRpCEzH0Nw9j6J)
- originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, but lived in various places

Here you can find my informal explorations and sojournings into quantitative sciences, music, and other fields. Enjoy!

## My current work

[Risk.net - Adia wealth fund is building supergroup of quant investing](https://www.risk.net/investing/quant-investing/7929061/adia-wealth-fund-is-building-supergroup-of-quant-investing)

My primary work at ADIA focuses on mobilizing alternative data for systematic strategies & semi-systematic investments. This spans the full range, from research proof-of-concepts, to final production pipelines that feed investment algorithms and processes

**Research & development.** This is a full-stack quant research role, with a specialization in *financial data science*.

- **Data sourcing**: sourcing datasets, talking to vendors, trialing and evaluating potential investment alpha
- **Data curation**: understanding the information content of datasets, their statistical properties and biases
- **Data science**: constructing and evaluating useful features and signals for investment
- **Alpha research**: contributions to backtesting and portfolio optimization
- **Research**: developing, analyzing and presenting strategies to the wider group for feedback and robustness
- **Production**: building and monitoring production data pipelines, monitoring anomalies and investigating outages

**Domain.** I focus on industrial economics, transportation, and complex networks. I have also contributed to other systematic/semi-systematic work involving a variety of useful alternative data.

**Teaching.** Since my role is within a scientific investing team, I have also run a number of industry-academic projects via [ADIA Lab](https://www.adialab.ae/), the scientific institution of ADIA. These have primarily been in the form of MSc-level capstone projects, and some examples include:

- UCL/Oxford (MSc MCF): Nowcasting global trade with time series signatures & shipping data (2024)
- University of Toronto (MFRM): Nowcasting inflation with the Baltic indices (2023)
- Khalifa University (MSc Data Science): Studies in supply chains, institutional ownership and geographic revenue (2022)

## Before quantitative finance

Previously in the technology sector, I worked as a data scientist and research scientist at Snap Inc. (2017-2020), primarily on causal inference and econometric analysis to drive product and engineering strategy. Before that I worked briefly at Uber (2016-2017) on optimal driver-rider matching algorithms and engineering.

I studied the [MSc EME](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) program at the London School of Economics, and before that an undergrad in economics, statistics & machine learning at Princeton.

## Other

I am a lifelong classically trained musician (classical and jazz pianist) and so you may also find some quant-music explorations here.
